# code-typing

Code Typing is an app created to fit a need I have. I wanted to improve my touch typing skills. I used websites, which helped. However, typing normally is so different from typing code. I didn't find any applications that were specific to typing code, so I decided to build one!

This application has some code examples that you an get started with or type some of your own JavaScript code!

## Features:
  #### - Auto close of brackets when you type the opening side correctly to mimic a code editor.
    Custom algorithms to find corresponding closing brackets and manipulate the DOM to mark as correct and skip over.

#### - Enter your own code and have it returned formatted for you to type your own code. 
    Code snippet is sent to Node.js API that utilizes Puppeteer to have code formatted and returned in way that you can type.
